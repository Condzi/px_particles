@LabelName
    Description

===============================

@Improvement
    Mark stuff that we could improve. Consider using other labels firs.

@Safety
    We're missing some safety checks. For the memory allocation, for example.

@Speed
    Optimization ideas.

@MagicNumber
    Magic constant which could be a variable.

@DebugBreak
    We want to stop our execution when an error occurs. Right now we're doing it using `assert( false ), which isn't the best solution. Consider adding `sys_debug_break()`, which is cross-platform. It might use assert( false ) internally, however it will better express our code.

@CrossPlatform
    Some code may not be cross-platform. I'm developing this program using Visual Studio on Windows 10. Every comment with this label should have explanation of why this solution was used.
