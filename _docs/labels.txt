@LabelName
    Description

===============================

@Improvement
    Mark stuff that we could improve. Consider using other labels firs.

@GLDebug
    We're registering error callbacks in the gl.cpp, right after initializing all the pointers. Consider moving this code out of this function. Also, do neccessary check if we're in debug mode and we have valid funciton pointers.

@Safety
    We're missing some safety checks. For the memory allocation, for example.

@Aligment
    For optimal speed, vectorized memory should be aligned. Figure out how to do this correctly.

@Speed
    Optimization ideas.

@MagicNumber
    Magic constant which could be a variable.

@DebugBreak
    We want to stop our execution when an error occurs. Right now we're doing it using `assert( false ), which isn't the best solution. Consider adding `sys_debug_break()`, which is cross-platform. It might use assert( false ) internally, however it will better express our code.

@CrossPlatform
    Some code may not be cross-platform. I'm developing this program using Visual Studio on Windows 10. Every comment with this label should have explanation of why this solution was used.
