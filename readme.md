# OpenGL + SIMD
[YouTube video](https://youtu.be/A0FwfGXOCbs) It's a test project. Main purpose is to play with SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data). I'm using [vectorclass](https://github.com/vectorclass) library for SIMD, [SFML](https://github.com/sfml/sfml) for Window creation and input handling.

# Compiling
Just open the .sln using Visual Studio 2019 and compile. Binaries will in the `_binaries` folder.
